I am a software developer and a researcher
interested in design and implementation of programming languages,
living in Tokyo, Japan.
All posts are my own and should never be taken seriously.

I might not respond that fast, though 🙂.

# Research Interests

I am interested in the design and implementation of programming languages.
Here is a list of topics that I am into.

- Functional language
- Type system
- Software verification
- Graph transformation

       Graphs are a generalized concept that encompasses more complex data structures than trees,
       such as difference lists, doubly-linked lists, skip lists, and leaf-linked trees.
       Normally, these structures are handled with destructive assignments to heaps,
       which is opposed to a purely functional programming style and makes verification difficult.
       We propose a new
       purely functional language, \\(\lambda_{GT}\\), that handles graphs as immutable,
       first-class data structures with a pattern matching mechanism
       based on Graph Transformation and developed a new type system, \\(F_{GT}\\), for the language.
       Our approach is in contrast with the analysis of pointer manipulation programs
       using separation logic, shape analysis, etc. in that
       (i) we do not consider destructive operations
       but pattern matchings over graphs provided by the new higher-level language that
       abstract pointers and heaps away and that
       (ii) we pursue what properties can be established automatically using a rather simple typing framework.

       Graphs are a generalized concept that encompasses more complex data structures than trees,
       such as difference lists, doubly-linked lists, skip lists, and leaf-linked trees. Normally, these structures are handled
       with destructive assignments to heaps, as opposed to a purely functional programming style. We proposed
       a new purely functional language, λGT, that handles graphs as immutable, first-class data structures with
       a pattern matching mechanism based on Graph Transformation. Since graphs can be more complex than
       trees and require non-trivial formalism, the implementation of the language is also more complicated than
       ordinary functional languages. λGT is even more advanced than the ordinary graph transformation systems.
       We implemented a reference interpreter, a reference implementation of the language. We believe this
       is usable for further investigation, including in the design of real languages based on λGT. The interpreter
       is written in only 500 lines of OCaml code.

     Implementing G-Machine in HyperLMNtal, Bachelor thesis, 2020.
     <details><summary>Abstract</summary><div>
       Since language processing systems generally allocate/discard memory with complex reference relationships,
       including circular and indirect references,
       their implementation is often not trivial.
       Here, the allocated memory and the references can be abstracted to the labeled vertices and edges of a graph.
       And there exists a graph rewriting language,
       a programming language or a calculation model that can handle graph intuitively,
       safely and efficiently.
       Therefore, 
       the implementation of a language processing system can be highly expected as an application field of graph rewriting language.
       To show this, in this research,
       we implemented G-machine, the virtual machine for lazy evaluation,
       in hypergraph rewriting language, HyperLMNtal.
